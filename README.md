# Scripts for the AR project made for the "Defensoría de las niñas, niños y adolescentes de la Provincia de Córdoba" 

##  Augmented Reality using the Vuforia Library showing diverse scripts on different minigames and interactions on the unity engine.
You can find things like:
- UI interaction and functionality.
- Physics interactions with objects on the scene working properly on augmented reality.
- Some scripts with class Inheritance since we needed to override some functions on the Vuforia library to achieve our objectives for the app and also different npc functionality.
- A dialogue and animation system for the npc's, i could do this a lot better now withour the need for different scripts inhereting the main one but it achieves it's purpose and the scale of the app was small so i kept it that way.
- Multiple Minigames with their own UI and proper functionality on AR like: Soccer Ball Juggling, Knight's Combat against different enemies timing blocks and attacks, Car parking avoiding obstacles and a Ball maze physics game.
